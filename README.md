# sitFRA 2015
SAP Inside Track Frankfurt 2015 - technical solutions used at #sitFRA 21st of March in Frankfurt a.M.

Among other things we plan to open source:

- Agenda view (now and upcoming sessions + twitter widget) solution
- Rasperry Pi configutrtion for Agenda view
- Timlie Agenda viiew setup
- Agenda backbone (Google Spreadsheet)
- Music notification solution  (next sessions starts + session end)
