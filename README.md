# sitFRA 2015
SAP Inside Track Frankfurt 2015 - technical solutions used at #sitFRA 21st of March in Frankfurt a.M. 

We would like to share our solutions used at #sitFRA and hope that maybe some of what we implemented for SIT Frankfurt can be of use for the wider community. 

Among other things we plan to make the following things available:

- Agenda view (now and upcoming sessions + twitter widget) solution
- Rasperry Pi configutrtion for Agenda view
- Timlie Agenda viiew setup
- Agenda backbone (Google Spreadsheet)
- Music notification solution  (next sessions starts + session end)
- Countdown animitation (really just a power point)
- and more...

For more details see upcoming SCN blog post series ;)

Maybe in the long run.. this repository can help to start a combined community effoert to provide software solutions and best practices to help organize and manage community events like SAP Inside Tracks.
